  abstract =      {Chaos is usually regarded as a distinct alternative to random effects such as environmental fluctuations or external disturbances. We argue that strict separation between chaotic and stochastic dynamics in ecological systems is unnecessary and misleading, and we present a more comprehensive approach for systems subject to stochastic perturbations. The defining property of chaos is sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Chaotic systems are ''noise amplifiers'' that magnify perturbations; nonchaotic systems are ''noise mufflers'' that dampen perturbations. We also present statistical methods for detecting chaos in time-series data, based on using nonlinear time-series modeling to estimate the Lyapunov exponent lambda, which gives the average rate at which perturbation effects grow (lambda {\textgreater} 0) or decay (lambda {\textless} 0). These methods allow for dynamic noise and can detect low- dimensional chaos with realistic amounts of data. Results for natural and laboratory populations span the entire range from noise-dominated and strongly stable dynamics through weak chaos. The distribution of estimated Lyapunov exponents is concentrated near the transition between stable and chaotic dynamics. In such borderline cases the fluctuations in short- term Lyapunov exponents may be more informative than the average exponent lambda for characterizing nonlinear dynamics.},

abstract = {We used microcosm systems to test whether simple mathematical models can be valid descriptions of population and community dynamics. Our conclusion is that a priori mathematical formulations of interacting populations are unlikely to produce completely satisfying predictions because they tend to ignore important biological mechanisms. We employed the feedback between microcosm experiments and increasingly refined dynamic models to identify the critical biology governing population cycles in our system, a predator-prey (rotifer-algal) chemostat. Here we summarize the results from five years of work with this system, which confronted us with unexpected yet resolvable biological complexities. First, we found that age structure of the predator population is necessary to generate qualitatively correct predictions of population dynamics (stability versus cycles). Second, we identified rapid evolution of both the algae and rotifers (in separate instances) as critical processes occurring on the same time scale as the ecological dynamics. We have learned that microcosms may not just serve as a means to check model assumptions, but that the results of microcosm studies can lead to novel insights into the functioning of biological communities. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Levine2004a,
abstract = {Traditional conservation biology regards environmental fluctuations as detrimental to persistence, reducing long-term average growth rates and increasing the probability of extinction. By contrast, coexistence models from community ecology suggest that for species with dormancy, environmental fluctuations may be essential for persistence in competitive communities. We used models based on California grasslands to examine the influence of interannual fluctuations in the environment on the persistence of rare forbs competing with exotic grasses. Despite grasses and forbs independently possessing high fecundity in the same types of years, interspecific differences in germination biology and dormancy caused the rare forb to benefit from variation in the environment. Owing to the buildup of grass competitors, consecutive favorable years proved highly detrimental to forb persistence. Consequently, negative temporal autocorrelation, a low probability of a favorable year, and high variation in year quality all benefited the forb. In addition, the litter produced by grasses in a previously favorable year benefited forb persistence by inhibiting its germination into highly competitive grass environments. We conclude that contrary to conventional predictions of conservation and population biology, yearly fluctuations in climate may be essential for the persistence of rare species in invaded habitats.},

@article{Segoli2012a,
abstract = {The intensification of agriculture, including the increase in the spatial extent of monocultures, is widely expected to result in an increase in crop damage by herbivorous pests. The theoretical basis for this expectation is, however, unclear. We used a simulation model to explore the relationship between the field size of monocultural crops and season-long mean expected pest densities. We investigated how the underlying relationship between field size and pest densities might be influenced by the presence/absence of an effective natural enemy; by the relative dispersal abilities of the pest and natural enemy; by the ability of the pest and natural enemy to overwinter within the crop habitat; and by the pest's rate of reproduction in the crop. Our model predicts that the relationship between field size and pest densities may, under commonly satisfied conditions, assume any of several forms (positive, negative, hump-shaped, or essentially constant), depending on the biology of the organisms. Each of the underlying relationships between field size of monocultural crops and expected pest densities may motivate adoption of a different set of pest management tactics. Whereas positive relationships motivate tactics that facilitate early natural enemy colonization of the interior of large monocultures (e.g., by supplementing food resources within the crop), negative relationships may instead motivate a suite of farm-design approaches that reduce pest colonization of crop interiors by achieving larger functional field sizes (e.g., aggregating multiple fields of the same crop). ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Weigend2000a,
abstract = {A screening for iridoid compounds of 78 of 315 species from all major groups in Gronoviaceae and Loasaceae has been carried out. The results were compared to the systematic concepts in the family and distribution and ecology of the taxa. Iridoids are present in at least some species of all genera screened. Some simple, monomeric compounds (e.g., loganin, sweroside) are found in all major groups of the two families and represent the basic iridoid inventory. Other compounds are restricted to certain taxonomic groups: nine-carbon iridoids (e.g., deutzioside) are restricted to Mentzelia (Loasaceae subfam. Mentzelioideae), hetero-oligomeric iridoids (e.g., tricoloroside methyl ester, acerifolioside) are restricted to two small groups in Loasa (Loasa ser. Macrospermae and ser. Floribundae, Loasaceae subfam. Loasoideae), and oleosides (e.g., 10-hydroxyoleoside dimethyl ester) are restricted to the large genus Caiophora sensu Weigend). The distribution of certain iridoid compounds thus confirms some of the generic limits. Iridoid phytochemistry does not correlate with systematic entities above the generic level nor does it in any way correlate with the morphological evolution of taxa. Conversely, the amount and complexity of iridoid compounds present in taxa correlate positively with the aridity of their habitat and the extent of mammalian herbivore pressure.},
